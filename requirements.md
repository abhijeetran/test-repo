# Project Apex: The Intelligent Inventory Hub

## Vision
Build a beautiful, fast, and intuitive dashboard that empowers business owners to manage their inventory with zero frictionâ€”eliminating messy spreadsheets, lost notes, and lack of visibility.

## MVP Features (Must-Haves)

### 1. Dashboard Header
- Show total unique items
- Show count of items low on stock
- Show count of items out of stock

### 2. Inventory Table
- Display all items in a sortable table
- Columns: Name, SKU, Category, Price, Quantity

### 3. Search & Filter
- Real-time search bar to filter items

### 4. CRUD Operations
- Add new item (form/modal)
- Edit item details (edit button per row)
- Delete item (delete button per row with confirmation)

### 5. Low Stock Highlight
- Visually highlight items if quantity is below threshold (e.g., 10 units)

## Innovative Features (Stretch Goals)

### 1. Data Visualization
- Bar or pie chart showing item quantities by category

### 2. Image Uploads
- Allow users to upload a product image when creating/editing an item

### 3. Bulk Operations
- Implement batch delete using checkboxes on the table

### 4. Activity Log
- Panel showing the last 5-10 actions taken (e.g., "Item 'T-Shirt' created")
